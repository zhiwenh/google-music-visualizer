An elegant audio visualizer and website color transformation for Google Music! Being able to see the movement of your music makes it a lot more fun to listen to.

This app features 6 color themes, visualizer height adjustment, and visualizer rendering frequency adjustment.

To use just install, go to https://play.google.com/music, and pick a song to play! The bar at the bottom left hand corner labeled visualization gives you access to the visualizer options. To change the color theme click on the current color.

If you have any suggestions or feedback please send me an email! I'm currently actively working on this app and would love to make it better. The next major feature will be to give it equalizer options.
